# Fix "Database error granting user" Error

## 🚨 The Problem

You're seeing this error:
```
AuthRetryableFetchException: Database error granting user
```

This means the `handle_new_user()` trigger in Supabase is **failing** when trying to create user records.

## 🎯 The Solution (Choose One)

### Option 1: EMERGENCY_AUTH_FIX.sql (RECOMMENDED) ✅

**Best for: Complete fix that preserves user creation automation**

This script:
- ✅ Fixes the broken trigger with better error handling
- ✅ Creates records for existing users
- ✅ Simplifies RLS policies
- ✅ Grants all permissions
- ✅ Makes you admin automatically

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy all of `EMERGENCY_AUTH_FIX.sql`
3. Paste and run it
4. Restart your app
5. Try logging in

### Option 2: DISABLE_TRIGGER_QUICK_FIX.sql (FASTEST) ⚡

**Best for: Getting auth working IMMEDIATELY for testing**

This script:
- ✅ Disables the problematic trigger completely
- ✅ Removes all RLS restrictions
- ✅ Grants full permissions
- ⚠️ You'll need to manually manage user records

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy all of `DISABLE_TRIGGER_QUICK_FIX.sql`
3. Paste and run it
4. Restart your app
5. Try logging in
6. **Important**: After signup, manually create records in `public.users` table

## 🔍 What Caused This?

The previous database fixes created a trigger (`handle_new_user()`) that runs when a new user signs up. This trigger tries to:
1. Create a record in `public.users` table
2. Create a record in `public.user_profiles` table

But it's failing because of:
- ❌ Missing table permissions
- ❌ RLS policies blocking inserts
- ❌ Conflicting constraints
- ❌ Poor error handling in the trigger

## ✅ After Running the Fix

### You Should Be Able To:
- ✅ **Login** with existing accounts (@gmail.com, @mekar.ae, etc.)
- ✅ **Signup** with new accounts
- ✅ **Access** all app features
- ✅ **No more** 500 errors

### What Gets Fixed:
1. **Trigger** - Either fixed or disabled
2. **RLS Policies** - Simplified or disabled
3. **Permissions** - Full access granted
4. **Existing Users** - Records created for all auth users
5. **Admin Access** - First user made admin

## 🧪 Testing Steps

After running the fix:

1. **Test Login**:
   ```
   - Try logging in with an existing account
   - Should work without errors
   ```

2. **Test Signup**:
   ```
   - Create a new account with any email
   - Should complete successfully
   - Should auto-login after signup
   ```

3. **Test Features**:
   ```
   - Check if you can see tools
   - Try adding a tool
   - Check if admin features work
   ```

## 🔧 If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check Supabase Logs:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Click "Logs" → "Database"
3. Look for error messages
4. Share them with me

### Common Issues:

**"User already registered"**:
- This is OK! It means the user exists in `auth.users`
- Just try logging in instead of signing up

**"Invalid login credentials"**:
- Check your password
- Make sure you're using the correct email
- Try resetting password if needed

**"Access denied"**:
- Run `EMERGENCY_AUTH_FIX.sql` again
- Make sure RLS policies are updated

## 📊 Verification Queries

After running the fix, you can check status:

```sql
-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'on_auth_user_created';

-- Check users
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.users;

-- Check profiles
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.user_profiles;

-- Check admins
SELECT * FROM public.users WHERE role = 'admin';

-- Check RLS status
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('users', 'user_profiles', 'tools');
```

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

1. **First**: Try `EMERGENCY_AUTH_FIX.sql` (most complete)
2. **If that fails**: Try `DISABLE_TRIGGER_QUICK_FIX.sql` (simplest)
3. **If still fails**: Share the Supabase logs with me

## 💡 Pro Tip

After auth is working, you can always:
- Re-enable RLS with proper policies later
- Add back the trigger with better error handling
- Fine-tune permissions for production

For now, let's just **get you logged in!** 🚀
