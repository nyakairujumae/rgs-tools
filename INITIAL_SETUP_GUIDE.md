# Initial Setup Guide for Existing Companies

## Problem
Your company already has technicians with tools, but the app only allows admins to add tools.

## Solution: Admin-Only Initial Setup

### Step 1: Admin Account Setup
1. **Create admin account first** - This person will be the "Tool Manager" or "Operations Manager"
2. **Admin imports all existing tools** using the bulk import feature
3. **Admin creates technician accounts** for all existing technicians
4. **Admin assigns tools to technicians** using the assign tool feature

### Step 2: Bulk Tool Import Process
1. **Prepare CSV file** with all existing tools:
   ```
   name,category,brand,model,serial_number,purchase_date,purchase_price,current_value,condition,location,status,notes
   "Drill Set","Power Tools","DeWalt","DCD791","DW123456","2023-01-15",299.99,250.00,"Good","Warehouse A","Available",""
   "Multimeter","Electrical","Fluke","87V","FL789012","2023-02-20",199.99,180.00,"Excellent","Warehouse B","Available",""
   ```

2. **Admin uses bulk import** to add all tools at once
3. **Admin assigns tools** to appropriate technicians

### Step 3: Technician Onboarding
1. **Technicians receive login credentials**
2. **Technicians can immediately see their assigned tools**
3. **Technicians can checkout/checkin tools** as needed

## Benefits
- ✅ **Controlled data entry** - Only admins can add tools
- ✅ **Bulk import capability** - Handle hundreds of tools quickly
- ✅ **Proper assignment** - Tools are properly assigned to technicians
- ✅ **Audit trail** - All tools have proper ownership and history

## Alternative: Temporary Admin Access
If you need technicians to add their own tools initially:
1. **Temporarily promote technicians to admin** for initial setup
2. **After setup, demote back to technician** role
3. **Use role management** in the admin panel
