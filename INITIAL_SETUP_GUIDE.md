# Initial Setup Guide for Existing Companies

## Problem
Your company already has technicians with tools, but the app only allows admins to add tools.

## Solution: Technician Tool Registration

### Step 1: Admin Account Setup
1. **Create admin account first** - This person will be the "Tool Manager" or "Operations Manager"
2. **Admin creates technician accounts** for all existing technicians
3. **Technicians register their existing tools** using the temporary add tool feature
4. **Admin can then assign tools** using the bulk assignment feature

### Step 2: Technician Tool Registration Process
1. **Technicians receive login credentials** from admin
2. **Technicians use "Add Tool" feature** to register their existing tools
3. **Each technician adds their tools** one by one during initial setup
4. **Admin reviews and assigns tools** as needed using bulk assignment

### Step 3: Post-Setup
1. **Remove technician add tool access** after initial setup is complete
2. **Normal operation** - only admins can add new tools
3. **Technicians can checkout/checkin** their assigned tools

## Benefits
- ✅ **Technicians know their tools best** - They can add accurate details
- ✅ **No bulk import needed** - Tools weren't documented before
- ✅ **Controlled process** - Admin manages the overall setup
- ✅ **Accurate data** - Technicians provide real tool information

## Workflow
1. **Admin creates accounts** for all technicians
2. **Technicians log in** and add their existing tools
3. **Admin reviews** all registered tools
4. **Admin uses bulk assignment** to assign tools to technicians
5. **Normal operation** begins with proper tool management
